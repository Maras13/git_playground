# 🧙‍♂️ Advanced Git Wizardry: Exercises to Master Version Control 🛠️

Congratulations, Git master-in-training! 🎓 You're about to embark on a journey through the labyrinth of advanced Git techniques. Let’s push (pun intended) your skills to the next level! 🚀

## **🧵 Exercise 1: Advanced Branch Management**

1. Create a repository with the following structure:

 main ├── featureA ├── featureB

 2. Create branches `featureA` and `featureB` from `main`. 
3. On `featureA`, modify a file and commit the changes. ✍️
4. On `featureB`, modify the **same file differently** and commit the changes. 😱
5. Merge both `featureA` and `featureB` into `main`. Resolve the epic merge conflict. ⚔️
6. Visualize the battle scars using `git log --graph`.

**🎯 Goal:** Conquer branching, merging, and conflict resolution like a Git ninja. 🥷

## **🪄 Exercise 2: Interactive Rebase**
1. Create a branch `rebase-exercise` and make five commits. (Go wild with creativity! 🎨)
2. Decide that two commits in the middle were... a terrible idea. 😬
3. Use `git rebase -i` to erase them from history like they never happened. 🧠
4. Squash the last two commits together into a glorious masterpiece. 🏆

**🎯 Goal:** Clean up your commit history like a pro janitor. 🧹

## **🍒 Exercise 3: Cherry-picking**
1. Create a branch `bugfix` and make **two unrelated commits** fixing different bugs. 🐞
2. Switch back to `main`. (Don’t panic. Stay calm. 🧘)
3. Cherry-pick just **one of the commits** to `main`.
4. Confirm that only your chosen commit was applied. 🎯

**🎯 Goal:** Selectively apply the creme de la commit. 🍰

## **🔍 Exercise 4: Bisecting**
1. Create a repository with 10 commits. Hide a pesky bug in one of them. 🐛
2. Use `git bisect` to find the bug like a Git detective. 🔎

**🎯 Goal:** Master the art of debugging with precision and flair. 🕵️

## **🛠️ Exercise 5: Stash Management**
1. Make a change to a file but don’t commit it. (You rebel, you. 😎)
2. Stash the change using `git stash`. 👜
3. Make additional changes and stash them too.
4. List all your stashes like a treasure map. 🗺️
5. Apply the **first stash selectively** and drop the remaining stash like a hot potato. 🥔

**🎯 Goal:** Master temporary changes and stash away your secrets. 🤐

## **📦 Exercise 6: Submodules**
1. Create a main repository and a separate repository for a library. 📚
2. Add the library as a submodule to the main repository. 
3. Make a change in the library and update the submodule in the main repo.
4. Use `git submodule update` to sync changes like a boss. 🤖

**🎯 Goal:** Manage submodules without losing your sanity. 🧠

## **📜 Exercise 7: Advanced Logging and Searching**
1. Clone a repository with a hefty commit history. (The more, the messier! 🐘)
2. Use `git log` with options (`--author`, `--grep`, `--since`, etc.) to find:
- Commits by a specific **author**. 🕵️
- Commits containing a specific **keyword**. 🔑
- Commits made after a specific **date**. 📅
3. Use `git blame` to figure out who did what, line by line. 😏

**🎯 Goal:** Log and search like a Git historian. 📖

## **😵 Exercise 8: Detached HEAD State**
1. Check out a specific commit using its SHA (enter the **detached HEAD state**—spooky! 👻).
2. Make some changes and commit them. 
3. Switch back to a branch and merge the changes from your detached state. 🪄

**🎯 Goal:** Embrace the detached HEAD state and wield it wisely. 🧙

---

## **⚔️ Exercise 9: Advanced Conflict Resolution**
1. Create three branches (`feature1`, `feature2`, `feature3`) that **all modify the same lines** in a file. 🔥
2. Merge `feature1` and `feature2` into `main`, resolving the ensuing conflict. 🥊
3. Finally, merge `feature3` into `main` and resolve the next conflict.

**🎯 Goal:** Become the ultimate merge conflict warrior. 🏅

---

## **💡 Exercise 10: Custom Git Aliases**
1. Define custom aliases for frequently used Git commands (e.g., `git lg` for a visual log). 🎨
2. Test your aliases in a variety of situations. 
3. Share your alias magic with your team and become their hero. 🦸

**🎯 Goal:** Make Git your obedient servant with custom aliases. 🐶
